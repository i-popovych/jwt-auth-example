# JWT Authorization with Express.js, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, and Email Verification

This repository demonstrates how to implement JWT-based authorization with email verification using Express.js, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, and email sending capabilities. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are utilized for secure API endpoints, and refresh tokens allow obtaining new access tokens without requiring users to log in again. Additionally, email verification ensures that only valid users can access the application.
